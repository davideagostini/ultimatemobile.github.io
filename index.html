      <h2>"Building modern mobile apps is too difficult".</h2>
      <p>Building mobile applications is complicated, 
        you have found a lot of documentation but you don't know where to start, 
        what path to follow or what choice is right to make?</p>

      <p><b>If you have also had these doubts, then you are in the right place!</b></p>

      <p>This is the course that would help me a lot when I approached Android development.</p>
      
      <p>This course will show the journey from <b>zero lines of code</b> to <b>production</b> for a real mobile app.
        At the end of the course, you will have built an application 
        that you can launch on the <b>Google Play Store</b>.

      <h2>Not your typical course.</h2>
      <p>Have you ever wondered how the large mobile applications 
        you use on a daily basis are built? What are the main technologies, 
        or what patterns are used?
      </p>
      <p>
        We build a complete Android application using the full potential of the 
        <b>Kotlin</b> programming language. We are going to have a <b>clean architecture</b> 
        in our project, you will learn how to organize your project structure and 
        maintain good code readability.
