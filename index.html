      <h2>"Building modern mobile apps is too difficult".</h2>
      <p>Surfing the net have you found many manuals, 
        many courses but you don't know which path to follow?</p>

      <p><b>If you have also had these doubts, then you are in the right place!</b></p>

      <p>This is the course I would have preferred to follow 
        when I started to get passionate about the Android world. 
        A course created by an Android developer for anyone who wants to become 
        a full-time Android developer.
        I have compiled a series of necessary topics to know,
        for those who enter the world of Android development.
        At the end of the course you will <b>not receive certificates but knowledge!</b>
      </p>

      <p>In this course I will show how to build a real mobile app from 
        <b>zero lines of code</b> to <b>production</b>.
        At the end of the course, you will have built an application 
        that you can launch on the <b>Google Play Store</b>. 
      </p>

      <p>
        The strengths of my video course are:
        <ul>
          <li>Clear</li>
          <li>Concise</li>
          <li>Learning to doing</li>
          <li>Beginner Friendly</li>
          <li>Open-Source Code</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h2>Course overview.</h2>
      <p>Have you ever wondered how the large mobile applications 
        you use on a daily basis are built? What are the main technologies, 
        or what patterns are used?
      </p>
      <p>
        We build a complete Android application using the full potential of the 
        <b>Kotlin</b> programming language. We are going to have a <b>clean architecture</b> 
        in our project, you will learn how to organize your project structure and 
        maintain good code readability.
      </p>
